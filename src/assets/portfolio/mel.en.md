This website was developed as part of a UX Webdesign training course at Technocité in partnership with Design Innovation.

The project consists of designing and developing a website for our client Mélanie to promote her permaculture business Mél'égumes.

Since the client didn't have any content or graphics, we had to create everything ourselves in teams of three people.

My colleagues took care of the layout, the graphic and textual content, while I took care of the coding of the website.
