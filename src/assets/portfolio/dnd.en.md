I participated with a group of friends in a Dungeons & Dragons tabletop role-playing game. In this game, each person has its own character sheet in paper where all the information about their characters is indicated.

So I came up with the idea of making this character sheet in web format. Not only will it be in digital format, but it will also do the calculations automatically with the different associated statistics.

To simplify the sharing of our character sheets, all changes made are saved in the URL as parameters.
