The main purpose of this group exercise was to put into practice the allocation of tasks in a group work, the use of GIT with several people and the practical application of AJAX requests.

The goal of this exercise was to reproduce a mock-up of a website and make it functional. For this, we used [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API to provide an up-to-date list and details of the movies.

The different members of my group had the task of taking care of different parts of the website while I took care of the API queries and displaying the list of movies and information.

The only big problem we had was a miscoordination at the start of the project, but after that, everything went smoothly.
