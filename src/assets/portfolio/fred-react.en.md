### My personal website (React)

* 2019-2021
* Used technologies: React, Sass
* Project finished in one month

I launched this project of creating my own website in order to exhibit myself online and to showcase my project. This allowed me to put more React into practice and to discover the process of hosting websites.

So I went from creating the mock-up to the development and the online hosting of my website.

What motivated me to develop it in React is its speed and the ability to use reusable components to display multiple items with the same layout, which is extremely useful for displaying my career and portfolio items.

It also allowed me to discover the online hosting process. I took a VPS and a domain name from OVH, so I had to manually install the prerequisite through the Ubuntu terminal of my VPS and send my website through FTP.
