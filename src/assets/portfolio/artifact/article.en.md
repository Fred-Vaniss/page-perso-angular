This is a complete recreation of my end-of-study project website (created in 2017).

At that time, I had almost no knowledge about creating a website and best practices, so I had just taken a Bootstrap theme and changed it, the result in mobile format was quite catastrophic.

So I embarked on this project to recreate my website from scratch in order to apply what I've learned in UX Webdesign course at Technocit√©.

This recreation doesn't depend on Bootstrap and all the features of the website are made in vanilla JavaScript. I also made some improvements on the layout and it is now perfectly responsive.
