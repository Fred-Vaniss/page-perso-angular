I developed a React application designed to track goals within a defined time period. Each tracker includes a start date, an end date, a target value, and adjustable increments to measure progress.

A visual progress bar, combined with a time bar, compares actual progress against the remaining time, indicating whether the goal is ahead or behind schedule.

The application also allows users to reorganize, edit, or delete trackers for more flexible management.
