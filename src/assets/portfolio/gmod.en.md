### Addons for Garry's Mod
#### Personal projects

* 2020 - 2021
* Used technologies: LUA

During my free time, I develop addons for Garry's Mod. It's both a video game and an artistic tool, it's highly modulable by the possibility to add LUA coded scripts within the game.

The creations can be published on the Steam Workshop where everyone can install created addons.

### HEMA HUD
#### Animated heads-up display

This addon were commissioned by someone which I got renumerated for this task. It is a heads-up display for an addons pack about a zombie apocalypse survival called Hematolysis. This HUD were completely designed by myself.

It features an electrocardigogram as a health indicator like Resident Evil (animated with AfterEffect). The ammo clip counter display individual bullets in a container and animate as bullets are shots.

### FPV Drone
#### Pilotable FPV drone

My real life hobby is piloting FPV drone. It's a drone where there is no stabilization assist, we can turn in every angle and we wear a mask on the eyes that transmit what the drone sees.

I developed this addon that reproduces approximately the piloting of a real FPV drone and where we can enjoy in countless of maps created by the Garry's Mod community.

This also was my very first programmed entity where I had to manage the client side and the server side of this addon.
