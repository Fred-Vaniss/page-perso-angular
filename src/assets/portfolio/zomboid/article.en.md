### Addons for Project Zomboid
#### Personal projects

* 2022
* Used technologies: LUA

[Project Zomboid](https://projectzomboid.com/blog/the-game/) is a survival game in a world under a zombie apocalypse. We create a character and the goal is simply to survive and fulfill our needs on a huge world.

The game is very modular and allows to add new features to the game and even modify the world. <br/> It has a *Steam Workshop* where everyone can publish their creations so others can modify their own game experience.

### Mini Health Panel
#### User interface

Developing an addon for Project Zomboid was a big challenge. Unlike Garry's Mod, there is no documentation for addon development. So I had to read and "decipher" myself the LUA files already established by the developers and other addons by the community in order to figure out how the game's functions works.

It took some time to understand but I managed to develop an addon which made its small success on the workshop of the game.

I created a minimalistic health panel. The silhouette is invisible by default and appears on the screen whenever there is a wound to treat.

This addon's purpose is to be able to do without the health interface of the base's game which take a lot of screen space and displays only when needed instead of always keeping it on screen or having to click on the health icon as soon you need to treat your character.

Many people appreciated my work and was the most popular of the week and the last three months.
