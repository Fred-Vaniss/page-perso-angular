My first internship project at ADEVO Solutions is to design and build a website to promote and sell a Heliostart product and services. It is a box that allows to automating the operation of a sunbed using an Android application, it also offers website creation services.

The project was based on a WordPress theme. The site being customized, it was necessary to modify the CSS a lot and a lot of elements were built in raw HTML

I also had to apply my graphic and web designer skills. I had a mock-up of what the website should look like, but I had to create a lot of graphic elements for the website, such as the logo, the background of the homepage, the pictograms and so on.

The part that required the most of the work is certainly the order page, for this part I had to create a PHP shortcode so that the prices are up to date with the data entered in WooCommerce articles, then I had to use JavaScript to do the calculation and display the summary according to the selected articles.
And in order to add the items correctly to the cart, I also used JavaScript to update the order links to put in the select items in the cart.
