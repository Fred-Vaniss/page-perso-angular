Unlike Heliostart, this was a project that I have supported, I mainly made changes and new features to the website.

Indeed, I created a new module for the website, which is the side panel, I created it from scratch, we can insert the modules we want. Thus it serves as a small form so that the customer can be called by the company in the time slot he wants.

Another change I made is the timeline in the page *about*. Before it had just the buttons on the left, I modified it to make it scroll by itself until you interact with it and added two buttons on the sides to go to the next and previous slide.

And the last modification I made to the website is the integration of a *lightbox* image preview in the website for the pages *our services* and *our realizations*.
