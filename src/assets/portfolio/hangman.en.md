It was at first just a little exercise with a "prompt" that asks the person to choose a letter and display in the console the guessed letters and the number of trials remaining.

Except that I went much further than what was asked for in the exercise, I used the HTML page to interact with the game while we had not mentioned the DOM in the course yet.
As I progressed, I even added random words, complex words with dashes, apostrophes and accents. Finally, I put a gigantic list in a JSON file.

Then I went even further by displaying the famous stickman as we use the trials and a virtual keyboard that changes color whether the letter is in the word or not.

More details in the README of my Github repository.
